### Project description
Find out the number generated with less amount of attempts as possible.

### Case
as per [Project description](https://github.com/Zelfreg/P1/tree/master/First_one/README.md#Project-description)

***Conditions***
- randomly generated number 1-100
- algorithm should use feedback based on number comparison

***Quality metrics***

Result is evaluating on average amount of attempts required (as less as better).

***Practice upon***
- coding on python3.X
- organizing coding process

### Data info
...

### Project stages
Three functions created:
  
    1) vanga_foo - counting amount of attempts required
    2) num_gen - generating array of numbers
    3) get_av_attempt - evaluating average amount attempts per 1000 cases

### Result
During evaluation the optimum in 6 attepmts was reached.

### Conclusion
Loads of time wasted for castomization, meh...
